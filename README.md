## About This Project
FlexClinic is a hackathon project that we five created. Its an Artificial Intellegence/Augmented Reality app to assist users with physiotherapy based on the issue diagnosed by the
custom Machine learning model for the symptoms. Due to Covid-19 most clincs and hospitals are
really busy and often you might not find a spot. We use a custom traffic routing algorithm to sort clinics available for you.
Users can consult a doctor and proceed with the app for virtual treatment or
book an appoimtement.
Solve all your muscular issues with FlexClinic during this pandemic!
