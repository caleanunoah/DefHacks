In this app, the user detects human poses and records the result to Fritz. For an example of a real time implementation of pose estimation, check out the [Fritz AI Studio app](https://github.com/fritzlabs/fritz-examples/blob/master/Android/FritzAIStudio/app/src/main/java/ai/fritz/aistudio/activities/vision/PoseEstimationActivity.java)

This example app uses the on-device Pose Estimation API for Android.
